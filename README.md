# Genealogy scripts

This is a very basic collection of Python 3 scripts to download and manipulate records from Portale Antenati.

## TODO

### download_ancestors.py

- ~~Use progress bar to show downloads~~
- Get all the info you need from register page
  - Make it recursive
- Fix the link writing

### croppy.py

- Make it use argparse
